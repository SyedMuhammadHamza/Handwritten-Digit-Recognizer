# Model Performance
* DNN:  98.45% test accuracy
* CNN:  99.25% test accuracy

# Productionization
In this step, I built a flask API endpoint that was hosted on a local webserver

# Technologies 
* Python
* Numpy for data cleaning
* Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
* keras for model building
* Python flask for HTTP server
* HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
